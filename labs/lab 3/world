#
# This file is parsed line by line to gather the data of a saved state for any world.
#
# Each line begins with a command, described below, then any number of spaces:
# - '#' Specifies a comment
# - 'Rows:': Specifies the height of the world
# - 'Cols:': Specifies the width of the world
# - 'Background:': Specifies a row of background ImageLibrary keys
#   - Must occur only after 'Rows' and 'Cols' is are specified
#   - May only be used a number of times equal to the height of the world
#   - Must contain a number of keys equal to the width of the world
#   - Each ImageLibrary key is separated by a *single* space
#   - The position of each key in the row corresponds to its column position in the world
#   - The first occurrence corresponds to row position zero in the world, the second to position one, etc.
# - 'Actor:': Specifies an actor that exists in the world.
#   - The format for this is as follows:
#     ```
#     KEY X_POSITION Y_POSITION UPDATE_PERIOD
#     ```
#     where the values in rest depend on the key.
#   - Entities can be specified without an id, leaving two spaces between the [key] and [x] position
#
# The remainder of this file contains commands to construct the world
