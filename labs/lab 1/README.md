# Lab 1

## Course Information

- **Course:** CSC 203
- **Instructor:** Professor Vanessa Rivera
- **Term:** 2023-24 Spring Quarter

## Overview

Welcome to your first lab assignment!

This project is designed to introduce you to the basics of Java programming, version control with Git, and basic usage of IntelliJ IDEA Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

## Learning Objectives

In completing this assessment, you will be able to:

- Translate a Python program to Java. (☕)
- Develop and run a complete Java program. (🛠️)

## Instructions

### Task: Translate the Python Program to Java

**🎯 Task Goal:** Modify `src/Lab1.java` to behave as the given `lab1.py` file.

1. **Examine the Python Script:** Open the `lab1.py` file in IntelliJ IDEA.
   Understand what each line of code does.
   If you need help (or haven’t learned Python) please ask me or a classmate to explain things.
   You are not expected to know Python this quarter, but will need to understand this file enough to write an equivalent Java version.
   - **Note:** The expected output of executing this script is given in `expected_output.txt`.
2. **Modify the Java Class:** Open the `src/Lab1.java` in IntelliJ IDEA.
   Complete this empty class by translating the given Python file to Java.
   In doing so, you must convert each line of code to equivalent Java code, including comments.
   Be sure to use the types of statements that *best* align with the original code and comments.
   You should start by creating a Java `main` method within the given `Lab1` class, as this defines a "runnable" class.
3. **Iterate and Refine:** As you write your program, you may verify its functionality by pressing the green "Run" button in IntelliJ IDEA.
   You are finished when you've translated each line of code and the program produces the same output, including whitespace.

> [!NOTE]
> 
> For string formatting, you may either use `System.out.println` or the static `String.format` methods.
> See the resource section below for more information.

## Resources

- [The Java Tutorials: Strings](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/data/strings.html): An official tutorial on strings. String formatting is described in the final section.

## Success Checklist

- [ ] Translated `lab1.py` to Java within the `Lab1.java` class.
  - [ ] Used the appropriate type of loops as specified by comments.
  - [ ] Added the additional method that acts as the function from the original program.
  - [ ] Output matches `expected_output.txt`, including whitespace.
- [ ] Committed and pushed changes to GitHub.
- [ ] Submitted screenshot evidence of your GitHub submission to Canvas.
  - [ ] The repository name is included.
  - [ ] The number of commits is included.
  - [ ] The green checkmark is included.
